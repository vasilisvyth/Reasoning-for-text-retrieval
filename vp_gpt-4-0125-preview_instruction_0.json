Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Novels about fairies and sprites excluding American speculative fiction novels"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: what are some 1934 British novels that are not Novels set in England"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non social psychology Books about apartheid"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Animated non-children films set in New York (state)"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Books about military personnel that exclude the Holocaust."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Eocene animals of South America that aren't extinct"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Films based on works by Bill Finger that are any genre except Animated action films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Superhero, but not sci-fi, crossover films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Orchids of Myanmar that arent palearctic"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Islam and society books that don't include Islamic fundamentalism."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: what are some Pandanus that are not Paleotropical flora?"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Plants that are native to Romania, but not Eastern Europe"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Trees of Western Canada, but not Flora of the Western United States"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Trees in the North-Central Unites States, but not in the Southeastern United States."

Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: David Weber novels that are not American speculative fiction"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: what are Films set in Libya that are not set in Tunisia"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Orchids of Myanmar excluding Flora of Thailand"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Birds of the Falkland Islands, not found in Chile"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Reptiles from Taiwan that exclude reptiles from China."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-silent and non-drama lost films from 1910"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-political history books about France"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-Canadian documentary films about Indigenous peoples in Canada"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Novels from the 1810's that are not set in the Napoleonic Wars."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Adventure horror films not based on folklore"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: what are some Films about bats that are not Superhero films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non freshwater fish of Oceania that are from Papua New Guinea"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Birds of the Sierra Madre Oriental but not native to the Western United States"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: 2012 science fiction novels that are not american novels."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-science-fiction non-comedy animated science fantasy films made in America"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Novels set in the 1810s excluding Novels about war and conflict"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: movies based on novellas that arent about scientists"

Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Films set in Hiroshima Prefecture, excluding films about the Pacific War"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Czech WWII films, not about totalitarianism"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Books about cultural geography but not about creativity"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Amphibians native to Nicaragua, but not Panama"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-action Masala films in the 1990s."

Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations.

If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-English-language Canadian action thriller films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Reptiles of Haiti but not Fauna of the Greater Antilles"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: books by Edgar rice burrows that arent fantasy"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Novels set in the Mediterranean Sea but not Italy"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Prehistoric toothed whales that aren't from the Neogene period"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Reptiles of Trinidad and Tobago not found in Venezuela"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-fiction books about genocide, excluding history."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: 1934 British novels not set in the United Kingdom"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Cenozoic birds of South America excluding Neogene animals of South America"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Novels about nobility not based on actual events"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: British Empire, but not Pakistan, history books"

Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: apartheid books that aren't about the military"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Films about proms excluding American teen films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Fauna of South India that are not Asian prehistoric reptiles"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Prehistoric marine mammals excluding Neogene"

Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Plants found in Alberta but not found in Northwestern United States"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Trees found in the Great Lakes region of North America that are not found in Southeastern United States"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Flora of Sinaloa not found in Sonora"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Children's books from 1999 that are not fiction books."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: South-central Pacific Flora excluding French Polynesia."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: 1940s animated films, excluding American animated films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Young adult literature based films that aren't teen films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Books about Islam and society but not Political"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non American teen superhero films"

Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Documentary films about Afghanistan, that aren't about terrorism"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: African, but not freshwater, Crustaceans"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Trees of Eastern Canada excluding Flora of the North-Central United States"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Even-toed ungulates that arent extinct"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: 2000s non-action vigilante films."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Hispanic and Latino American novels set anywhere besides North America"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Georges Simenon novels not set in Paris"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Georges Simenon novels that are not detective novels."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Mammals of Sri Lanka excluding Mammals of India"

Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Books about cultural geography but not about cities"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: 1998 non-fiction children's books"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: novles by Robert B parker that arent set in boston"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: 1930 non american crime films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Books about monarchs that don't include Napoleon."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Films set in 1918 that excluding War films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Arctic land animals excluding Mammals of North America"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Plant life found in Finland, but not Russia"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Films shot in Iraq, but not about Iraq war"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Hong Kong supernatural films based on folklore"

Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: adventure horror films that arent american"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Beatles in film that are not biographical films."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Marine fauna that are not fish from the Gulf of California."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Novels by Agatha Christie that were not first published in serial form"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Orchids of Peru that are not in Ecuador"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Pliocene animals of South America that aren't prehistoric"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non American teen 1990's coming-of-age comedy films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: 1940 crime comedy films that are not American crime films."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Birds from the Sierra Madre Oriental, but not the Sierra Madre del Sur"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non Miocene prehistoric marine mammals"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Russian empire films that are not in black and white."

Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Birds native to the Sierra Madre Oriental, but not the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: 1998 children's books that aren't 1998 fiction books."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Demon novels that are not fantasy series"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Trees of New Guinea not found in Southeast Asia"

Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations.

If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Demon, but no Campus, novels"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-fiction and non-psychological books about genocide"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: 1960s sex comedy, but not American, films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Endemic fauna of Yemen are not fauna of East Asia"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Birds of the Sierra Madre Oriental that are not in the United States"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Documentary films about adolescence but not education"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Books that are only about pop music"

Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-freshwater crustaceans of Africa"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Prehistoric birds of Europe but not Cenozoic"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-Canadian books that are about Quebec."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Plants found in the Bahamas but not the Southeastern United States"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Trees of New Guinea excluding Trees of Malesia"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America) that are not in Canada"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-fiction books about genocide excluding Political books"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Georges Simenon novels that are not about crime"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non Jews and Judaism Books by Isaac Asimov"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Films, but not North African campaign films, set in Libya"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non- Philippine films set in Metro Manila."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: what are some American magic realism novels that aren't Novels set in the United States"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Arthropods of Vietnam excluding Insects of Southeast Asia"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-English books by Barrie & Jenkins."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-American 1910's war drama films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non American independent films that are from 1994"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: what are some Books about cultural geography that are not about the arts"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-dance gymnastics films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Children's, but not illustrated, books adapted into films"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Pliocene animals of South America excluding Mammals of South America"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non- drama Indian family films."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Films set in Hiroshima Prefecture, but not set in the Sh\u014dwa period."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Endemic flora of Peninsular Malaysia, excluding trees of Malesia"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-American sci-fi novels by David Weber"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Non-Arthopod Parastacidae of Australia"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Nigerian romance films that are not dramas"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Freshwater fish of Malaysia excluding Fish of Thailand"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Flora of the Central African Republic that is not in Nigeria"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Endemic flora of Peninsular Malaysia, excluding trees"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Prehistoric marine mammals excluding Miocene animals"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: nonfiction genocide books that don't involve the military"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Early Triassic reptiles of South America"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: what are  Films based on works by Arthur Conan Doyle that are not set in England"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Films that are about the radio, but not mass media people"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Tyranni birds that aren't from South America"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Books about the British Empire, excluding the information about British India."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Novels set in the 1810s not about disasters"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Birds of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt but not of the Sierra Madre del Sur"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Novels about intersex not by Marion Zimmer Bradley"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Flora of Sierra Leone but not of Ivory Coast"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Films that are about mobile phones, but not the internet"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Orchids of Myanmar but not Thailand"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Orchids of Myanmar but not India"

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Vigilante films based in Hong Kong that exclude martial arts."

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: Penal system documentary films that are not about law enforcement in the United States"

Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively.

Here's how you should proceed:\n1. Break down the query into smaller questions. Each question should be represented as a Python string variable named question_i, where `i` denotes the question number. Ensure that these string variables do not contain logical operators such as `not` and that they make sense. For simple queries define only one question.\n2. For each question_i, invoke the find_docs method with the question_i as an argument. Store the returned results as docs_i, where `i` represents the question number. Please refrain from defining the find_docs function.\n3. Create a new variable named `ans` to combine the docs_i using the correct logical operations. You can utilize only the logical operators  `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` if necessary to combine the questions. Avoid using parentheses or any other symbols. If you only created one question, logical operators are not needed.\nPlease provide your solution using Python code exclusively. Do not provide explanations or additional output.\nquery: what are some Amphibians of Nicaragua that are not Fauna of Panama"
